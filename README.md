# <Koi/Alex's Prework Study Guide Webpage!>

## Description

The Prework Study Guide web page was designed to be a one stop shop locale for all the notes that I've taken up to this point during my prework assignments for my bootcamp. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

Each segment of the webpage, broken up by boxes with titles, displays notes that I have taken from my prework assignments. I can read the notes or I can go into the console by right clicking the page and pressing the 'inspect' button which displays a random topic chosen from HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
