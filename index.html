        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>There are different types of headers defined by the tags h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6.</li>
          <li>To create a bulleted list like this one, use the tag "ul"</li>
          <li>A numbered list uses the tag "ol"</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>There are three types of CSS style sheets: inline, internal style sheet, and external style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline styles are used to set CSS styles within the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheets can also be made in the HTML file, but are more flexible than inline styles.</li>
          <li>Finally, external style sheets are separate files to style your HTML. These are helpful to keep our code clean.</li>
          <li>CSS elements are borken down into selectors and declarations</li>
          <li>Selectors define the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>

          <li>pro tip, you can also use that command to switch branches without creating a new one, just don't type -b</li>
          <li>git pull origin branch-name: pulls my latest update from my repo on GitHub</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: pushes my changes to my GitHub repo</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values</li>
          <li>There are several data types, but there are 5 commonly used types:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>A string is a sequence of text. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quotes (ex. 'Hello').</li>
            <li>A number is... well... a number. Numbers don't need quotes around them.</li>
            <li>Boolean describes a value that is true or false. The words 'true' and 'false' are special keywords that don't need quote marks.</li>
            <li>An array is a structure that allows someone to store multiple values in a single reference</li>
            <li>Finally, an object. This can pretty much be anything. In fact, everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable</li>
          </ol>
          <li>A for loop contains three important statements:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Example: 'var x = 0';</li>
            <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. Example: 'x < shapes.length;'</li>
            <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each time. Example: 'x++'</li>
            <li>Side note: The code 'x++' is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1</li>
          </ol>
        </ul>
